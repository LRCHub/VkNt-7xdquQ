```lrc
[00:52.20] Realize that I can never win
[00:55.01] Sometimes feel like I have failed
[00:57.59] Inside where do I begin?
[00:59.91] My mind is laughing at me
[01:12.41] 
[01:02.42] Tell me why am I to blame?
[01:05.10] Aren't we supposed to be the same?
[01:07.74] That's why I will never tame
[01:10.25] This thing that's burning in me
[01:25.75] 
[01:15.50] I am the one who chose my path
[01:20.42] I am the one who couldn't last
[01:25.62] I feel the life pulled from me
[01:30.45] I feel the anger changing me
[01:44.45] 
[01:36.32] Sometimes I can never tell
[01:38.76] If I've got something after me
[01:41.10] That's why I just beg and plead
[01:43.89] For this curse to leave me
[01:56.89] 
[01:46.75] Tell me why am I to blame?
[01:49.08] Aren't we suppose to be the same?
[01:51.59] That's why I will never tame
[01:54.15] This thing that's burning in me
[02:09.65] 
[01:59.54] I am the one who chose my path
[02:04.54] I am the one who couldn't last
[02:09.24] I feel the life pulled from me
[02:14.24] I feel the anger changing me
[02:28.24] 
[02:30.28] Betrayed, I feel so enslaved
[02:37.84] I really tried, I did my time
[02:48.31] I did my time
[02:54.81] 
[02:58.17] I did my time
[03:09.62] I did my time
[03:19.22] I did my time
[03:25.72] 
[03:32.04] I am the one who chose my path
[03:37.46] I am the one who couldn't last
[03:42.37] I feel the life pulled from me
[03:47.79] I feel the anger changing me
[04:01.79] 
[03:52.98] Oh God, the anger's changing me
[03:57.62] Oh God, the anger's changing me
